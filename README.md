# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This application is a basic template for a prework study guide.  I made to practice some basic techniques of coding.  At this point, it probably solved more problems for me than it will anyone else, but maybe it will be used by some future student as a guide for how to construct theirs.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each of the sections contains a growing list of notes about a certain basic topic in coding like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  If the user opens the DevTools console, they can see the JavaScript in the application running.  It will list the basic topics and randomly recommend one of the topics for the user to study.
